        <div class="result-description">The company has a complete view of customer experiences over time. It captures integrated feedback about the overall relationship across all product and service lines and after all key interactions. Feedback is collected from all parties involved at each stage of the customer journey, including business partners and end-users. For example, feedback from multiple stakeholders in a purchasing decision (e.g., procurement, executives) is captured across different points in time and different channels.</div>

        <div class="result-description">Customer experience data is tracked and analyzed by customer segment as well as relevant product or service line. The company has a clear understanding of customer segments, products, and service offerings that are over or under-represented in the data. Representativeness of the data may be improved by targeting under-represented segments when collecting feedback. ‘Silent accounts,’ where no individual provides feedback, are flagged for further investigation.</div>

        <div class="result-description">All customer stakeholders find it engaging to share feedback with the company. Solicited feedback is complemented with unsolicited feedback, making it easy for customers to give feedback on their terms. Employees systematically capture feedback from customer conversations alongside other formal feedback collection. The company regularly tests innovative feedback collection techniques that are not yet broadly used in the industry. Feedback design is optimized to achieve high response rates.</div>
