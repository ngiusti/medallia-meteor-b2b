All internal stakeholders from executives to the front line have direct access to customer feedback in formats consistent with how they work today (e.g., mobile app, CRM, call center systems).

        <div class="result-description">Feedback is automatically tied to specific individuals and business units that impacted the customer experience, including non-customer-facing roles. Reporting is tailored to support the decision making needs of each role, including alerts that drive teams to take action and escalate issues. For example, the billing department can receive alerts and view reports with feedback from all customers who experienced a billing issue. Similarly, account managers can view account-level feedback from across the customer journey. Dynamic reports provide teams with the flexibility to explore emerging questions.</div>
