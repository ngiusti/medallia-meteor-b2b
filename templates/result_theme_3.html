        <div class="result-description">Systems and workflows are in place to respond to all actionable feedback in a timely manner. Systems automatically route feedback to the appropriate internal owner for follow-up, and allow for reassignment or collaboration across functions or business units based on the nature of the feedback. Peer-to-peer follow-up conversations (e.g., executive to executive) are encouraged, especially for dissatisfied customers. Aggregated account feedback is shared with the customer and embedded into an account action plan. Learning is systematically captured and used to analyze root causes, enabling team-level and cross-functional improvements.</div>
